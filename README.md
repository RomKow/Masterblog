## Project Overview 

MasterBlog is a simple Flask-based blogging application that allows users to create, read, update, delete, and like blog posts. Blog data is stored in a JSON file (`posts.json`), and the application supports basic CRUD operations via intuitive routes and modern UI buttons.

## Features

* **Add Posts**: Users can add new posts with author, title, and content.
* **Update Posts**: Existing posts can be edited via a pre-filled form.
* **Delete Posts**: Posts can be removed with a confirmation prompt.
* **Like Posts**: Users can increment a postâ€™s like count with a single click.

## To-Do

* **User Management**: Implement authorization so that admin tasks (update, delete) are restricted to authorized users.
